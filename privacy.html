                    As used in these Terms, “Vite”, “ViteLabs” and “ViteX” refers to the company Vite Labs Limited, including, without limitation, its owners, directors, investors, employees, or other related parties. “Cryptocurrency,” “token,” “asset,” “digital asset,” “altcoin,” “coin,” “good,” and “ledger entry,” and “smart contract” all refer to data entries in a blockchain-based software ledger.
                    Please review the terms described herein carefully. Your use of the ViteX is contingent on your acceptance of these Terms and all the Terms and policies incorporated herein. You cannot use ViteX if you do not agree to these terms, and your use and participation means you agree and accept these Terms and Conditions. These terms are void where prohibited by law, and the right to access and use the Website is revoked in any such jurisdiction.
                    PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY. IT IS AN AGREEMENT AND CONTAINS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE TERMS OF OUR SERVICES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE OUR SERVICES.
                    By using our Services, you accept and are bound by the Terms below.
                    Unless otherwise indicated, the Services and all content and other materials in the Services, including, without limitation, the ViteX trademark and/or logo, and all designs, text, graphics, pictures, information, data, software, sound files, other files and the selection and arrangement thereof (collectively, the ViteX Content) are the proprietary property of Vite Labs or its sponsors, or licensors and are protected by international copyright and/or other intellectual property laws.
                    Subject to these Terms, ViteLabs grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and fully revocable license (the ViteLabs License) to access and use the Services during the time that you are in compliance with these Terms.

                    UPDATING YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION
            </div>
            <div>
                It is your responsibility as a user to keep your primary address registered with the ViteLabs mailing list so that we can communicate with you. In the event that we send an electronic communication to you but you do not receive it because your primary email address registered with us is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or otherwise unable to receive electronic communications, we will still be deemed to have provided the communication to you. If you use a spam filter that blocks emails from senders not listed in your email address book, it is your responsibility to add ViteLabs to your address book so that you are able to receive communications from us.
                    DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
            </div>


                ViteX provides a secure, convenient platform for exchanging digital assets on the Ethereum network. Users deposit their assets to the ViteX smart contract, and, through the ViteX Website, authorize Ethereum transactions to exchange those assets for other assets on the same network. You may use our platform to exchange digital assets directly with us or with other parties using the ViteX contract. The exchange rate and quantity of assets is defined by the two parties participating in the exchange. Our services do not allow users to exchange their assets for anything other than assets on the Ethereum network.
                FEES AND AUTHORIZATION
                ViteX charges a transaction fee for both parties involved in the exchange. By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to these transaction fees.
                TAXES
                It is your sole responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and to collect, report, and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. Vite is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transaction, or for collecting, reporting, or remitting any taxes arising from any transaction.
                THE ETHEREUM WALLET
                You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Ethereum wallet and any device that you utilize in connection with the Services, and ensuring that no unauthorized person has access to your Ethereum wallet or any device that you utilize in connection with the Services.
                USE OF THE SERVICE
                Your use of the Services shall be for non-commercial purposes, which means you shall not sublicense, rent, lease, sell, trade, gift, bequeath or otherwise transfer any license associated with the Services to anyone.

                ACCOUNT SUSPENSION AND CLOSURE
                ViteLabs reserves the sole and absolute right to refuse to let you open an account, suspend your account, or terminate your account or your use of one or more of the Services. Such actions may be taken as a result of your violation of the terms of this Agreement.
                You may terminate this Agreement at any time by closing your account and discontinuing use of the Services. Upon termination of this Agreement and your account, you remain liable for all transactions made while the account was open. If you used the Services to commit a crime, we will close your account.
                You agree that ViteLabs will not be liable to you or to any third party for termination of their access to the Services.
                THIRD-PARTY CONTENT
                In using our Services, you may view content provided by third parties, including links to web pages of such parties. We do not control, endorse or adopt any Third-Party Content, and shall have no responsibility for Third-Party Content, including but not limited to material that may be misleading, incomplete, erroneous, offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable. Any business dealings or correspondence with such Third-Parties are solely between you and the Third-Parties. Vite is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings, and you understand that your use of Third-Party Content and your interactions with Third-Parties is at your own risk.
                DISCLAIMER: RISKS RELATED TO CRYPTOCURRENCY AND USE OF OUR SERVICE AND RISKS RELATED TO USE OF ETHEREUM PLATFORM
                ViteLabs is not liable for any damages that may arise out of or in connection with your use of this Website. This includes, but is not limited to, claims, applications, injuries, delays, direct loss, loss of business or profits, business interruption costs, loss of goodwill or business profits, loss of cryptocurrency or digital assets, damage caused by your computer, computer software, systems and programs, and the data thereon or any other direct or indirect, consequential and incidental damages. In addition, Vite is not liable for any losses incurred, either directly or indirectly through your use of the Website or any of its functions and features (collectively, all of the foregoing items shall be referred to herein as “losses”). Vite is hereby released by you from liability for any and all losses. These limitations of liability apply whether the liability or losses are based on negligence, contract, tort, or any other basis, even if Vite has been advised or should have known of the possibility of such losses.
                Users of this Website are responsible for the results of their actions, and are responsible for protecting access to information to the Website including, but not limited to, private keys, passwords, and JSON wallet files.
                ViteLabs is not held liable for any malfunction, breakdown, delay or interruption to the Internet connection, or if for any other reason our Website is unavailable for any period of time.
                ViteLabs is not responsible for any problems that may result from the use of the Ethereum platform, or any problems arising from the Ethereum code.
                ViteLabs is not an insured financial institution. As a result, unlike funds held in most banks or credit unions, amounts displayed through the Services are not insured against loss.
                APPLICABLE LAW AND ARBITRATION
                You and ViteLabs agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or your use of the Services. Arbitration prevents you from suing in court or from having a jury trial. You and ViteLabs agree to notify each other in writing of any dispute within sixty days of when it arises.
                In addition, you and ViteLabs also agree:

                To attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration;
                That any arbitration will occur in the British Virgin Islands;
                That any arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator, selected by a third-party arbitration forum;
                That the district courts in the British Virgin Islands have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration; and
                That the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.
                Any dispute between the parties will be governed by these Terms and the laws of the British Virgin Islands, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.
                You will only be permitted to pursue claims against us on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative action or proceeding, and you will only be permitted to seek relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) on an individual basis.
                FORCE MAJEURE
                ViteLabs will not be deemed in default of these Terms to the extent that performance of its obligations or attempts to cure any breach are delayed or prevented by reason of any external force including, but not limited to, war, insurrections, bank failures, strikes, fires, floods, earthquakes, labor disputes, epidemics, governmental regulations, freight embargoes, natural disaster, act of government or any other cause beyond our reasonable control.
                LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION
                You hereby expressly understand and agree that ViteLabs and our affiliates and service providers, and their respective officers, directors, agents, joint ventures, employees, and representatives will not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary or consequential damages for loss of profits, use, data, or business associated with the use of the Service.
                You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless ViteLabs, its subsidiaries, affiliates, independent contractors, service providers and consultants, and their respective directors, employees and agents from and against any claims, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of your use of the Services in any form.
                NO WARRANTY
                The Services are provided as is and without any representation of warranty, whether express, implied, or statutory. ViteLabs, our affiliates, officers, directors, agents, joint venturers, employees, and suppliers specifically disclaim any implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
                ViteLabs does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to any part of the Services, and operation of our site may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control. ViteLabs will make reasonable efforts to ensure that transactions are processed in a timely manner, but we make no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete transactions because the Services are dependent upon many external factors.
                PROHIBITED JURISDICTIONS
                Our Services may not be available to you due to your residency, geographic location, or eligibility criteria. Certain jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimers may not apply to you.
                It is prohibited to access, download or use the Services in the following jurisdictions:
                New York;
                Washington; and,
                North Korea
                Any user that is found to be using the Service from one of the aforementioned jurisdictions will lose access to their account and their funds will be frozen until the direct withdrawal function activates and the user can interact with the ViteX contract directly to withdraw their assets.
                WAIVER AND CONFLICT
                The failure of ViteLabs to exercise or enforce any right or provision in these Terms shall not operate as a waiver. As it relates to the Services, if there is ever a conflict between these Terms and any other terms or policies these Terms will control.
                DISCLOSURES TO LEGAL AUTHORITIES AND AUTHORIZED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
                ViteLabs may share your personal information with law enforcement, data protection authorities, government officials, and other authorities in the following situations:

                When disclosure is necessary to investigate violations of our Terms or Privacy Policy.

                ViteLabs reserves the right to amend, change, add, remove, or alter portions of these Terms, at any time.

                In the event that you disagree with any new amendments and alterations to the Terms, you may withdraw your consent by canceling your account.
