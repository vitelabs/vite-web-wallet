            <div class="content">
                ViteX provides a secure, convenient platform for exchanging digital assets on the Ethereum network. Users deposit their assets to the ViteX smart contract, and, through the ViteX Website, authorize Ethereum transactions to exchange those assets for other assets on the same network. You may use our platform to exchange digital assets directly with us or with other parties using the ViteX contract. The exchange rate and quantity of assets is defined by the two parties participating in the exchange. Our services do not allow users to exchange their assets for anything other than assets on the Ethereum network.
            </div>
            <h5>FEES AND AUTHORIZATION</h5>
